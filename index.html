        <h1>Average Tip Calculator Assignment </h1>

        <p> This time, John and his family went to 5 different restaurants. The bills were $124, 48, 268, 180 and 42.
  
            John likes ot tipe 20% of the bill when the bill is less than $50. 15%  when the bill is between $50 and $200, and 10% if the ill is more than $200.
            
            Implement a tip calculator using objects and loops.
            
            1- create an object with the array for the bill values.
            
            2- Add a method to calculate the tip
            
            3- This method should include a loop to iterate over all the paid bills and do the tip calculations
            
            4- As an outpu, create 1) a new array cotainer all tips, and 2) an array container final paid amounts (bill + tip).
            
            HINT start with two empty arrays [ ] as properties and then fill them up in the loop.

            <p>Extra 
                Marks Familty also went on a holiday, going to four different restaurants. The bills were $77, 375, 110, and 45.
                Mark likes to tips 20%  when the bill is less than 100 dollars.

                10% when the bill is between 100 and 300 dollars 

                and 25% if the bill si higher than 300 dollars

        
            </p>

            <p>Create a function (not a method) to calculate the average of a give array of tips. HINT loop over the array, and in each iteration store the current sum in a variable. 
                (starting from 0). 
                
                After you have the sum of the array, divide it by the number of elements in it (thats how you calculate the average)

                Calculate the average tip for each family 

                log to the console which family paid the highest tips on average.
