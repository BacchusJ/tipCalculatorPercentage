# tipCalculatorPercentage

<p> This time, John and his family went to 5 different restaurants. The bills were $124, 48, 268, 180 and 42.
  
  John likes ot tipe 20% of the bill when the bill is less than $50. 15%  when the bill is between $50 and $200, and 10% if the ill is more than $200.
  
  Implement a tip calculator using objects and loops.
  
  1- create an object with the array for the bill values.
  
  2- Add a method to calculate the tip
  
  3- This method should include a loop to iterate over all the paid bills and do the tip calculations
  
  4- As an outpu, create 1) a new array cotainer all tips, and 2) an array container final paid amounts (bill + tip).
  
  HINT start with two empty arrays [ ] as properties and then fill them up in the loop.
